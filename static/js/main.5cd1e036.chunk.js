To famed Achilles, invincible warrior, the king gave command of a thousand ships.\\\\n\\\\nAcross stormy seas and salted beach, soldiers sieged the city. Arrow and stone, blade and barb bounced from Achilles\u2019 skin. Bathed as a babe in the River Styx by his Nereid mother, his hide was hardened, imperviously made. Through every charge, every death-defying battle, Achilles was at the fore. Troy hung poised to crumble.\\\\n\\\\nUntil Agamemnon gave slight to the mighty myrmidon. In grave offense, Achilles pulled his forces from the field. Hector, boldest, bravest, eldest of the Trojan princes seized the chance to push the Greeks to the sea. Water\u2019s reflection mirrored scorching sails as Hector fired their ships. All seemed lost until Achilles rose to meet him. Fierce and fast the two titans fought, but Hector\u2019s spear felled Achilles fair. Though Patroclus, it was, in the armor of Achilles, not Achilles who lay dead.\\\\n\\\\nWrathful at the loss of his faithful friend, Achilles donned armor newly-made and challenged Hector alone. Spear and blade and amor rang, but Achilles could not be harmed. Hector, prince of Troy, died in battle that day.\\\\n\\\\nParis, brother lost, tearful-eyed, let arrow loose, guided by divine envy. For there were Gods that could not suffer Achilles to survive. Straight and true the arrow flew and harpooned Achilles\u2019 heel, where his mother held him when submerged. The wound was deep, his weakness found, Achilles met his end.\\\\n\\\\nA decade thence, from Hades\u2019 depths, Achilles has been drawn. Armored now, upon the heel, revenge his only aim.

Viewers traveled leagues just to see her art. So wondrous and majestic were her tapestries, it was said the spinner must have been instructed by the patron Goddess of Weavers herself, Athena. To this comparison, Arachne proudly scoffed, claiming not even the Gods rivaled her talent at weaving.\\\\n\\\\nWhen Athena heard this, disguised as a crone, she visited Arachne and encouraged her to show proper respect to the Gods. Arachne dismissed the old woman and issued a challenge that no God, not even Athena, could weave better than she. Furious, Athena revealed herself and accepted the challenge.\\\\n\\\\nThey both set to the loom with fervor. Athena wove a glorious tapestry depicting her battle with Poseidon over the city of Athens. Her detail and imagery were exquisite. Yet Arachne\u2019s weavings depicted Zeus in his many infidelities with mortals. So flawless, so lifelike was her artistry, not even Athena could refute the skill, nor could she contain her anger at such a sleight.

None adhere more vigorously to this creed than Bacchus, the Roman God of Wine, lewd behavior, and madness.\\\\n\\\\nAfter spending much of his formative years with his impressively intoxicated mentor Solinus, whom Bacchus loves like a father, the God of Wine is now a wanderer and teacher. He\u2019s journeyed across all of Asia, through India, and finally back to Rome, spreading the \u201cMysteries of the Vine,\u201d a ritual involving incredible amounts of wine to lower inhibitions, freeing one from social constraints, oppression of gender, sexual taboos, and the stresses of life. Quite the successful ritual, if ever there was one.\\\\n\\\\nMuch of this ritual seems to have come from Solinus, who is widely known to have vast, secret knowledge and the ability to predict the future, though only while completely drunk. The king Midas, covetous of this knowledge, captured Solinus, endeavoring to extract it by providing the scholar the finest food, drink, and entertainment he could muster. Bacchus finally tracked down his mentor in the court of Midas and discovered him well fed and cared for. Quickly, Midas lied, claiming Solinus had been lost and the king had taken him in. Seeing through the ruse, Bacchus offered the monarch a boon. Midas asked that anything he touched be turned to gold. Without hesitation, Bacchus granted this. He tested his new gift on a twig and stone and found them turned completely to gold. Elated, Midas called a feast, but found his food turned to gold in his hands and his daughter solidified at his touch. Starving and crazed, Midas begged Bacchus to remove the \u201cgift.\u201d Bacchus acquiesced, allowing the greedy king to wash his hands in the Pactolus river. As the golden touch left his hands, the river sands transformed to glittering gold.\\\\n\\\\nOf course, the product of continuous overindulgence in alcohol and deviant behavior, Bacchus could simply be insane.","MP5PerLevel":0.4,"MagicProtection":30,"MagicProtectionPerLevel":0.9,"MagicalPower":185,"MagicalPowerPerLevel":7.5,"Mana":200,"ManaPerFive":4.8,"ManaPerLevel":40,"Name":"Bacchus","OnFreeRotation":"","Pantheon":"Roman","PhysicalPower":0,"PhysicalPowerPerLevel":0,"PhysicalProtection":19,"PhysicalProtectionPerLevel":3,"Pros":" High Crowd Control, High Defense","Roles":" Guardian","Speed":365,"Title":"God of Wine","Type":" Melee, Magical","abilityDescription1":{"itemDescription":{"cooldown":"10s","cost":"40/45/50/55/60","description":"Bacchus takes a drink from his jug, giving him additional Buffs.","menuitems":[{"description":"Ability:","value":"Buff"},{"description":"Affects:","value":"Self"}],"rankitems":[{"description":"Drunk-O-Meter:","value":"40%"},{"description":"Protections:","value":"15/20/25/30/35"},{"description":"Duration:","value":"6s"}]}},"abilityDescription2":{"itemDescription":{"cooldown":"16s","cost":"70/75/80/85/90","description":"Bacchus jumps into the air and, not so gracefully, comes slamming to the ground belly first, knocking all enemies into the air and dealing damage.

And for all the wonder and glory of the world he tries to impart upon his illustrious students, Chiron, it seems, must constantly teach them the art of war. \\\\n\\\\nFame and legend are the hallmarks of his pupils. Perseus, who beheaded Medusa, Ajax, who battled bravely against Troy, and Achilles, who Chiron practically raised from infancy, all are figures of renown. But it is for their acts of violence, not art or science, for which songs are sung of these heroes. Chiron would prefer the world a more contemplative place where mankind adored nature and kindled bonds of friendship over scholarly discussions. \\\\n\\\\nThough, to his wizened eyes, the brink has been reached and the world he finds so fascinating tilts toward annihilation. Set aside are his books and scrolls, the easel and brush, and taken up are his bow and armor. On thunderous hooves Chiron gallops to the field. To save all that he holds dear, Chiron, the Great Teacher, will go to war.","MP5PerLevel":0.38,"MagicProtection":30,"MagicProtectionPerLevel":0.9,"MagicalPower":0,"MagicalPowerPerLevel":0,"Mana":225,"ManaPerFive":4.4,"ManaPerLevel":40,"Name":"Chiron","OnFreeRotation":"","Pantheon":"Greek","PhysicalPower":35,"PhysicalPowerPerLevel":2.35,"PhysicalProtection":12,"PhysicalProtectionPerLevel":2.8,"Pros":" High Sustain, High Movement Speed","Roles":" Hunter","Speed":380,"Title":"The Great Teacher","Type":" Ranged, Physical","abilityDescription1":{"itemDescription":{"cooldown":"13s","cost":"55/60/65/70/75","description":"Chiron warns his teammates to evade the area, granting them .3s of Crowd Control Immunity so they can escape before it explodes and does damage to all enemies in the area.\\n\\nApplies Target Mark","menuitems":[{"description":"Ability:","value":"Ground Target"},{"description":"Affects:","value":"Enemies and Allies"},{"description":"Damage:","value":"Physical"},{"description":"Radius:","value":"17.5"}],"rankitems":[{"description":"Damage:","value":"80/135/190/245/300 (+80% of your Physical Power)"}]}},"abilityDescription2":{"itemDescription":{"cooldown":"16s","cost":"65","description":"Chiron passively marks his enemies as targets when he damages them with Basic Attacks, Training Exercise, or Centaurus, reducing their Physical Protections by 5%.\\r\\nHe may activate this ability to fire seeking arrows at all marked targets within range, damaging and slowing them.","menuitems":[{"description":"Ability:","value":"Instant"},{"description":"Affects:","value":"Enemy Gods"},{"description":"Damage:","value":"Physical"}],"rankitems":[{"description":"Damage:","value":"55/90/125/160/195 (+70% of your Physical Power)"},{"description":"Mark Duration:","value":"3.5s"},{"description":"Slow:","value":"25/27.5/30/32.5/35%"},{"description":"Slow Duration:","value":"2s"}]}},"abilityDescription3":{"itemDescription":{"cooldown":"16s","cost":"70/75/80/85/90","description":"Chiron gallops forward damaging enemies, knocking up minions, and kicking enemy gods behind him.\\nChiron may fire Basic Attacks while charging.","menuitems":[{"description":"Ability:","value":"Dash"},{"description":"Affects:","value":"Enemies"},{"description":"Damage:","value":"Physical"}],"rankitems":[{"description":"Damage:","value":"70/95/120/145/170 (+50% of your Physical Power)"},{"description":"Bonus Power:","value":"10/20/30/40/50"}]}},"abilityDescription4":{"itemDescription":{"cooldown":"90s","cost":"80/90/100/110/120","description":"Chiron is transformed into a constellation, and can fire three long-distance shots, even through walls.\\nIf Chiron would be killed during this ability, he does not die until he runs out of time or shots.

Surprised, Cupid cut himself on his own arrow and fell immediately in love with Psyche.\\\\n\\\\nFurious, Venus would not let Cupid marry Psyche, so Cupid stopped shooting arrows, people stopped falling in love and stopped worshipping Venus. Panicked, the Goddess of beauty relented and Cupid went back to work. Psyche was whisked to a secret location. Cupid visited her only at night so she could not see who he was. Fearing him to be a terrible monster, Psyche waited for Cupid to fall asleep and lit a lantern. Surprised at what she found, she accidentally scraped one of Cupid\u2019s arrows and fell in love with him.\\\\n\\\\nVenus was displeased and forbade Psyche to see her son, forcing her to complete a series of impossible challenges that Psyche overcame only with mystical help.

As a show of faith, he demanded one of them place a hand in his mouth, and if the ribbon proved magical in nature, he would exact punishment. Brave, if foolish, Tyr put his fist in Fenrir\u2019s maw as the ribbon was secured to the wolf\u2019s leg. Fenrir strained and screamed, but could not break free, and in rage, he devoured Tyr\u2019s hand.\\\\n\\\\nFor a time, Fenrir was forgotten, the dire prophecy just a memory.

As a God, he is a guardian of justice, a hero to the downtrodden, the Saint of War.\\\\n\\\\nIn the ancient times of the East, a great war between Three Kingdoms raged. The warlord Liu Bei, and his friends, Zheng Fei, and the mighty Guan Yu swore an oath of brotherhood in a mystical peach garden, vowing to create a new, righteous world. Together, they fought countless battles against the warlords Cao Cao and Sun Quan, and Guan Yu grew famous for his combat prowess and unwavering honor.\\\\n\\\\nDuring the war, Cao Cao captured Guan Yu. At the time, Liu Bei\u2019s fate was uncertain, so he agreed to fight for Cao Cao under specific terms, chiefly that he would abandon Cao Cao if ever he learned the whereabouts of his sworn brother. Despite Cao Cao\u2019s gifts and promises of wealth, when Liu Bei resurfaced, Guan Yu immediately went to his side. Years later, Guan Yu again faced Cao Cao on the battlefield as the warlord fled from his defeat at Red Cliffs. Guan Yu cut off Cao Cao\u2019s retreat and obliterated his forces. Cao Cao, however, he spared and released, as a matter of honor.\\\\n\\\\nAfter his death, Guan Yu\u2019s spirit remained at a holy shrine, coming to the aid of nearby villagers in need, battling the cruel and selfish. From all over the East, worshippers came to the shrine and burned incense to honor him. Such popularity led to Faith, and thus Guan Yu was raised as a God, deified a few hundred years later.\\\\n\\\\nNow, he embodies the virtues he lived by. His statues, wielding a massive guan dao, ward against evil. Red faced to represent loyalty, his likeness is carried by merchants as proof they can be trusted.

And no guardian is more steadfast in their duties than keen-eyed Heimdallr, sentinel of the Bifrost. The watchman of Asgard is a sentry without equal in the Nine Realms and he maintains his eternal watch where the rainbow bridge meets the sky. With sharp eyes and keen hearing, Heimdallr stands guard over the halls of the gods, alert for the approach of any enemy as well as the first stirrings of Ragnarok.\\\\n\\\\nIt is said that Heimdallr requires less sleep than a bird, and can see for hundreds of leagues. His hearing is so sharp that he can perceive the soft whisper of growing grass, and the murmur of the dead. His trumpet, Gjallarhorn, can be heard across the Nine Worlds when blown. But it is not only his senses which make Heimdallr a superb sentinel.\\\\n\\\\nHe also possesses the gift of foresight, allowing him to predict his opponent\u2019s moves before they occur and to sense the approach of inimical forces. As befitting one of the Aesir, he is a masterful combatant, and his foreknowledge gives him an edge over all but the most unpredictable \u2013 or skilled \u2013 of opponents.\\\\n\\\\nToo, it is whispered that Heimdallr has some connection to Yggdrasil, the World Tree. Some insist he was fashioned whole from a splinter of the great ash tree, while others believe he is bound to it in some fashion, much like Ratatoskr. Whatever the case, it is known that Heimdallr takes a dim view of any who might threaten Yggdrasil.\\\\n\\\\nThus, when his keen gaze settled upon the creeping tendrils of Persephone\u2019s minions, drawing ever closer to the World Tree, Heimdallr moved instantly to confront them.

Then, using the beasts own claws, he skinned the hide, wearing the mantle proudly as his new armor.\\\\n\\\\nEurystheus was aghast upon the hero\u2019s return.

But a legendary journey to resurrect her murdered husband would make her a savior.\\\\n\\\\nFrom the God of Earth and Goddess of Sky, Isis was born, and she was a Goddess in her own right, loved by wealthy and poor alike, champion to sinners and slaves, artisans and aristocrats.

Meanwhile, Set\u2019s rule plunged the land into chaos incarnate, and all seemed truly lost. Unable to locate a final piece, Isis could wait no longer and summoned the potent powers of her magic to reassemble her husband and give him new life. That night, their love became a child, Horus, who would avenge his father and cast evil Set out of Egypt.\\\\n\\\\nHer bravery, tenacity, her skill and love drove Isis to save Egypt and become the mother of all Pharaohs. Long has she prayed that chaos would never again rise to threaten the rule of order and prosperity, but peaceful days are at an end.

A collector of secrets and ancient lore, Merlin is a master of arcane wizardry, able to wield a myriad of elements and harness them to his will. He also devoted his mind to the art of prophesy, one day foreseeing the rise of a ruler destined to stand above all others, and unite the land beneath his banner.\\\\n\\\\nWhen Uther Pendragon fell in battle against the barbarous hordes of the invading Saxons, Merlin swore an oath of fealty to his successor, Arthur. From that day, the mage never left the wielder of legendary Excalibur\u2019s side, a tireless advisor, fellow warrior, and friend. Together they brought about the rise of Camelot, and the unity of a once fractured land.

But her father was old and her brother a child, and so for love\u2019s sake, she set aside her loom and went to war in their place. She disguised herself as a young man, and no one was the wiser, for her father had trained her in the ways of the bow and the blade, making her the equal of any man in the army.\\\\n\\\\nFor twelve years, she maintained the pretence. She fought well against the enemies of China, attaining rank and the loyalty of her fellow soldiers. She led men into battle more than once, setting herself where the fighting was thickest so that those who followed her might see her and take heart. At the end of that twelve years, she was offered a high rank, but turned it down. Instead, having grown tired of war, she asked only that she might return home to her family. And so she did, her duty complete.\\\\n\\\\nBut some stories do not end when the hero returns home. For some stories, that is only the beginning. For now, a new danger stirs, and Hua Mulan must once more take up her weapons in defense of her homeland...","MP5PerLevel":0.4,"MagicProtection":30,"MagicProtectionPerLevel":0.9,"MagicalPower":0,"MagicalPowerPerLevel":0,"Mana":220,"ManaPerFive":4.7,"ManaPerLevel":38,"Name":"Mulan","OnFreeRotation":"","Pantheon":"Chinese","PhysicalPower":39,"PhysicalPowerPerLevel":2.2,"PhysicalProtection":18,"PhysicalProtectionPerLevel":3,"Pros":" High Area Damage","Roles":" Warrior","Speed":375,"Title":"The Ascendant Warrior","Type":" Melee, Physical","abilityDescription1":{"itemDescription":{"cooldown":"16/15/14/13/12s","cost":"60/65/70/75/80","description":"Mulan swings her sword with precision, striking twice and dealing damage to all enemies hit.\\n\\nSkilled - Mulan gains an Attack Speed increase after using this ability.\\nAdept - Mulan strikes a third time in a large cone in front of her.\\nMastered - Mulan gains 5% Attack Speed.","menuitems":[{"description":"Ability:","value":"Area"},{"description":"Affects:","value":"Enemies"},{"description":"Damage:","value":"Physical"},{"description":"Radius:","value":"25"}],"rankitems":[{"description":"Damage per Hit:","value":"75/95/115/135/155 (+30% of your Physical Power)"},{"description":"Attack Speed:","value":"25%"},{"description":"Duration:","value":"4s"}]}},"abilityDescription2":{"itemDescription":{"cooldown":"14s","cost":"50/55/60/65/70","description":"Mulan brings forth her spear striking in front of her, dealing damage and slowing all enemies hit.\\n\\nSkilled - Mulan heals for up to 3 enemies hit.\\nAdept - Mulan strikes a second time further in front of her, dealing bonus damage if she hits the same enemy.\\nMastered - Mulan gains 5% Power.","menuitems":[{"description":"Ability:","value":"Line"},{"description":"Affects:","value":"Enemies"},{"description":"Damage:","value":"Physical"},{"description":"Range:","value":"25"}],"rankitems":[{"description":"Damage per Hit:","value":"120/155/190/225/260 (+35% of your Physical Power)"},{"description":"Slow:","value":"20%"},{"description":"Duration:","value":"2s"},{"description":"Heal:","value":"15/30/45/60/75 (+10% of your Physical Power)"},{"description":"Bonus Damage:","value":"20/35/50/65/80 (+15% of your Physical Power)"}]}},"abilityDescription3":{"itemDescription":{"cooldown":"16s","cost":"60","description":"Mulan readies herself and fires an arrow with a rope attached to it.

What must it be like to live forever in the shadow of your brother? To be denied again and again that which you desire, despite the power of the wrathful seas at your command? So Poseidon broods on his throne at the ocean floor.\\\\n\\\\nAs a child, Poseidon and his brother, Hades, were consumed by their father, Cronus. Powerless to escape, it was left to mighty Zeus to free them and slay their patron. Together, they defeated the last of the Titans and ushered in a new age of dominance for Olympian Gods, but their freedom, their very lives, Zeus would never let either brother forget were owed to him. Even as the heavens, the underworld, and the seas were divided among them, Zeus positioned himself as king of all, and what was Poseidon to do but be thankful he had been spared a fate in his father\u2019s belly? So he retired to his new realm and began the pursuit of gathering worshippers.\\\\n\\\\nSoon rose a great ocean front city of mankind, and Poseidon presented himself as their God, but another had already come, Athena, Zeus\u2019 daughter. A competition was held \u2013 each God would offer a gift and the people would select their sponsor. Confident, Poseidon drove his Trident, a trophy from the battle against the Titans, into the ground and a limitless spring emerged, but the people found the water salty and undrinkable. Athena extended her hand and a graceful olive tree rose from the earth. Wood, food, and oil, all from one gift. The people decided and the city was called Athens.\\\\n\\\\nIt may be that Poseidon never desired greatness as Zeus did. Had his father never consumed him, had he never been made God of the Sea, had his brother never crowned himself King of the Gods, Poseidon might have lived contentedly, but that chance is gone. Now, with the very tides at his command, an army of sea beasts at his back, and the formidable Kraken at his call, the glowering God of the deep seeks to quench his thirsty rage and plunge all the world in endless, wrathful seas.","MP5PerLevel":0.4,"MagicProtection":30,"MagicProtectionPerLevel":0.9,"MagicalPower":175,"MagicalPowerPerLevel":7.5,"Mana":245,"ManaPerFive":4.6,"ManaPerLevel":40,"Name":"Poseidon","OnFreeRotation":"","Pantheon":"Greek","PhysicalPower":0,"PhysicalPowerPerLevel":0,"PhysicalProtection":8,"PhysicalProtectionPerLevel":2.6,"Pros":" High Area Damage","Roles":" Mage","Speed":360,"Title":"God of the Oceans","Type":" Ranged, Magical","abilityDescription1":{"itemDescription":{"cooldown":"10s","cost":"60/65/70/75/80","description":"Poseidon summons forth a wave that travels in a line, dealing damage and pushing back all enemies in its path.","menuitems":[{"description":"Ability:","value":"Line"},{"description":"Affects:","value":"Enemy"},{"description":"Damage:","value":"Magical"}],"rankitems":[{"description":"Damage:","value":"100/140/180/220/260 (+70% of your Magical Power)"},{"description":"Tidal Meter:","value":"-20% Tide"}]}},"abilityDescription2":{"itemDescription":{"cooldown":"20/18/16/14/12s","cost":"65/70/75/80/85","description":"Poseidon activates his Trident, granting movement speed and making his Basic Attacks fire 2 additional shots in a spread for 6s.

Now, that conflict was ended. Odin and his ilk openly boasted of their achievements, laughing and cheering while the floor ran wet with spilled spirits. \\\\n\\\\nThen, the doors swung wide, breathing icy winter wind across the hall. There she stood, spear in hand, skin, porcelain pale, clad in snow dusted furs, and eyes blue as glacier ice but smoldering with vengeful fire. Skadi, the Jotun\u2019s daughter had come. \\\\n\\\\nTransfixed by her beauty, the gathered Gods sought to dissuade her from violence. As a symbol of honor, Odin cast the eyes of her father into the heavens to twinkle as stars for eternity. Skadi was not moved. A life for a life, she demanded. \\\\n\\\\nIt was Loki that softened her heart with humor and dance. So jovial was he that, at last, her frozen features cracked a smile. \\\\n\\\\nA wedding! Odin declared. Skadi would marry a God and so, herself become a Goddess. This would be her payment for the life of her father. Now warmed to them, Skadi agreed. Blindfolded, she was to choose her husband by only his feet. Eligible men came forth and Skadi made her choice. \\\\n\\\\nTheir marriage did not last. Niord was a God of Summer and Skadi a Goddess of Winter. After a few years, they amicably parted ways. Skadi returned to the snow-capped mountains of her youth, but without her father or husband, she soon grew lonely. Word spread of a war between the Pantheons.

Despite these incredible gifts, Thor\u2019s enemies were cunning, bloodthirsty, and numerous. The Frost Giants constantly threatened to invade Asgard requiring every ounce of Thor\u2019s near limitless strength just to keep them at bay. Had the tide truly turned, Asgard might have been destroyed, but a simple prank played by the treacherous Loki ended with the creation of Mjolnir, the legendary hammer, and with it, Thor utterly crushed the Frost Giants.\\\\n\\\\nSif, Thor\u2019s wife, had hair like rays of sun through a cloudy sky, and Loki, being covetous, secretly sheared it off while she slept. Mad with fury, Thor demanded Loki fix this. So, Loki went to the dwarves of Ivaldi who forged a golden crown that would grow equally golden hair, a spear that never missed its mark, and a ship that would never sink. Proud of his treasures, Loki returned to Thor and the other Gods, gave the crown to Sif, then bragged that no greater items could be forged.\\\\n\\\\nThe dwarf Brokk took offense to this and claimed that he and his brother could do better. Loki bet his head they could not. So, Brokk and his brother forged three items, a ring that made a duplicate every nine days, a golden pig that could fly and swim, and the hammer, Mjolnir, with the power to shatter mountains. As each item was forged, Brokk was bitten fiercely by a fly, yet only on the third did he flinch, causing the short handle on the hammer. When they were done, the dwarves took their artifacts before the Gods and decried Loki\u2019s fly disguise. All the Gods agreed that Brokk and his brother had forged greater items. Loki, ever cunning, declared his neck was not part of the bargain, denying them his head.\\\\n\\\\nMjolnir went to Thor to battle the Frost Giants.

It is there that glory is found in the sanctity of a vow, once sworn, never broken, and bound by a ring, no matter how crude, then buried in the earth to weather the ages of time.\\\\n\\\\nThough rarely spoken of, he is highly regarded, even among the Gods, for it is Ullr, not one of Odin\u2019s sons that tends the throne of Asgard while the All Father is away. Other Gods might use the opportunity to abuse the power, but Ullr\u2019s rule is merely an extension thereof. So much so that only the innermost circle even know that Odin is gone.\\\\n\\\\nAll the more noticeable is it, then, that Ullr has abandoned this post to join the fray. Early on did Odin take the field of battle, leaving Ullr to manage the kingdom. So great a threat must this war be as to endanger the very survival of Asgard. Whatever the reason, Ullr comes to preserve glory, which, for him, may be the whole world.","MP5PerLevel":0.38,"MagicProtection":30,"MagicProtectionPerLevel":0.9,"MagicalPower":0,"MagicalPowerPerLevel":0,"Mana":230,"ManaPerFive":4.4,"ManaPerLevel":40,"Name":"Ullr","OnFreeRotation":"","Pantheon":"Norse","PhysicalPower":38,"PhysicalPowerPerLevel":2.4,"PhysicalProtection":13,"PhysicalProtectionPerLevel":3,"Pros":"

After conquering the Underworld and all the Earth, Bali managed to wrest the Heavens from the God Indra. Unable to reclaim his seat, Indra implored Vishnu for aid, and so Vishnu took the form of a small mortal man, a priest named Vamana.\\\\n\\\\nIn his splendid palace, Bali was giving gifts to the pious. Vishnu, disguised as the monk Vamana and carrying a wooden umbrella, requested only as much land as he could cover in three steps. Bali offered Vamana an island but Vamana stuck to his request, which Bali granted against the wishes of his advisor. Immediately, Vamana grew to cosmic proportions, crashing through the ceiling of the palace and filling the sky. With one colossal step, he engulfed all the Earth and the Underworld. With a second step, he consumed the heavens. Now, with everything under his two units, Vamana had nowhere to place his third step. He challenged Bali to go back on his word or offer somewhere else for him to step. Bali\u2019s demon army surged forth, but the demon king held them back. Bowing in humility, Bali offered his head as the third step. Vamana sends Bali to the underworld but, in recognizing Bali\u2019s benevolence, shows mercy by granting him sovereignty over it in appreciation of Bali\u2019s sacrifice.\\\\n\\\\nVishnu returned control of the Heavens to Indra and left his Avatar behind, but he also left behind a valuable lesson.
